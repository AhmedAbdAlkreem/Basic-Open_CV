# Basic-Open_CV
This repository explaine what is open cv and how to use it in computer vision.

# What is the perpose of this repoitory ?
To know using of Open CV in Computer Vision and be the first step befor learning machine learning
and deep learning in Computer Vision.

# What will you learn before finish it ?
1) know Open-CV libray.
2) how to read and resize the image using open-cv.
3) how to display the image using open-cv or matplotlip.
4) Could to converting image from type to another type.
5) You will know what is the edge detection.
6) Using sobel, lablacian and canny to detect edges from image.
7) Know what is the advantage of canny detection than other types.
8) Know the binary threshold and inverse binary threshold.
9) Threshold can be usefuel in segmentaion.
10) Using Otsu to make segmentation in the image.


 I hope to be this the fisrt step to learn computer vision field 
 and be very useful to you.
